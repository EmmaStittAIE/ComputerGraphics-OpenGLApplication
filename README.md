# ComputerGraphics-OpenGLApplication
Yet another readme I need to update one day.

# Build Instructions
I'll put something here about building assimp, since it's too big to include on its own. Ideally, I'll provide links to download/build (where relevant) all libraries I use, and then save a bunch of space by not uploading those to my repos.
